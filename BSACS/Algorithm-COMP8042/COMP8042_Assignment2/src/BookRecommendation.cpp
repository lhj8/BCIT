/**
 * @brief Generates a set of recommended books for a target user.
 *
 * This function provides a set of book recommendations based on the books borrowed
 * by a neighborhood of users. The recommendations are made by considering books
 * borrowed by the neighborhood users but not borrowed by the target user.
 *
 * 1. All books borrowed by the neighborhood (excluding the target user) are pushed onto a stack.
 * 2. An initialization process ensures every book borrowed by users in the neighborhood is
 *    represented in the bookBorrowedByUsers hashmap.
 * 3. Each book from the stack is compared against the books borrowed by the target user.
 *    (If a match is not found, the book is added to the recommended books set.)
 *
 * @param neighborhood An UnorderedSet of user IDs representing the neighborhood users.
 * @param targetUserID A string representing the ID of the target user for whom the
 *                     recommendations are to be generated.
 * @return An UnorderedSet of Book objects representing the recommended books for the target user.
